#Sick Holder!
Sick holder is a shim to support browser that don't have 'placeholder' capabilites. Unlike other libraries, this shim attempts to EXACTLY replicate native placholder behaviour.

##Requirements
jQuery best used with modernizr for full browser support (why use a plugin when the default behavior is supported?)

##Usage
Simply attach the .sickholder() function to a jQuery select. EG:
    $('input').sickholder();
You can also alter the included css files to change the look and feel of the text as well as the 'focus' styling.

##The Future
Updates will be coming soon, and will include more support.
